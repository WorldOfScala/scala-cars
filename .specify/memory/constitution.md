# Scala Cars Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code
All code must be clean, readable, and maintainable. Follow Scala best practices, use meaningful names, avoid complexity, and ensure code is self-documenting where possible.

### II. Simple UX
User interfaces must be simple, intuitive, and focused on user needs. Prioritize usability over features, minimize cognitive load, and ensure consistent navigation patterns.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass automated linting and formatting checks
- Pull requests require code review from at least one team member
- CI/CD pipeline must pass all tests before deployment

### Version Control
- Use Git with feature branches
- Commit messages must be descriptive and follow conventional commit format
- Main branch is protected and requires PR approval

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- User data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Compliance
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require:
1. Proposal with rationale
2. Team discussion and consensus
3. Documentation of changes
4. Implementation plan if needed

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Use README.md and docs/ for runtime development guidance.
